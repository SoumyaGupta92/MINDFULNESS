                    The most common types of mental illness are
                </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Anxiety disorders</li>
                    <li>Mood disorderssc</li>

                <h3>Anxiety disorders</h3> <br>
                <p>Anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental illness. People with these conditions have
                    severe
                    fear or anxiety, which relates to certain
                    objects or situations. Most people with an anxiety disorder will try to avoid
                    exposure to whatever triggers their anxiety.
                    Examples of anxiety disorders include :
                </p>
                <br> <br>
                <h3>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</h3> <br>
                <p>The American Psychiatric Association define GAD as disproportionate worry that
                    disrupts everyday living. People might also experience physical symptoms,including </p>
                <br>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Restlessness</li>
                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                    <li>Tense muscles</li>
                    <li>Interrupted sleep</li>
                </ul> <br>
                <p>About of anxiety symptoms does not necessarily need a specific trigger in people with GAD. They may
                    experience excessive anxiety on encountering everyday situations that do not present
                    a direct danger, such as chores or keeping appointments. A person with GAD may sometimes feel
                    anxiety with no trigger at all.</p>
                <br> <br>
                <h3>Panic disorders</h3> <br>
                <p>People with a panic disorder experience regular panic attacks, which involve sudden, overwhelming
                    terror or a sense of imminent disaster and death.</p>
                <br> <br>
                <h3>Phobias</h3> <br>
                <p>There are different types of phobia :</p>
                <br> <br>
                <h3>Simple phobias:</h3> <br>
                <p>These might involve a disproportionate fear of specific objects, scenarios, or animals. A fear of
                    spiders
                    is a common example.</p>
                <br> <br>
                <h3>Social Phobia</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Sometimes known as social anxiety, this is a fear of being subject to the judgment of others. People
                    with
                    social phobia often restrict their exposure to social environments.</p>
                <br> <br>
                <h3>Agoraphobia</h3>
                <br>
                <p>This term refers to a fear of situations in which getting away may be difficult, such as being
                    in an elevator or moving train. Many people misunderstand this phobia as a fear of being outside.
                    Phobias are deeply personal, and doctors do not know every type. There could be thousands of
                    phobias, and what might seem unusual to one person may be a severe problem that dominates daily life
                    for
                    another.</p>
                <br> <br>
                <h3>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</h3> <br>
                <p>People with OCD have obsessions and compulsions. In other words, they experience constant, stressful
                    thoughts
                    and a powerful urge to perform repetitive acts, such as hand washing.</p>
                <br> <br>
                <h3>Post-traumatic stress</h3>
                <br>
                <p>PTSD can occur after a person experiences or witnesses a deeply stressful or traumatic event. During
                    this
                    type of event, the person thinks that their life or other peopleâ€™s lives are in danger. They may
                    feel
                    afraid or that they have no control over what is happening. These sensations of trauma and fear may
                    then
                    contribute to PTSD.</p>
                <br> <br>
                <h3>Mood disorders</h3>
                <br>
                <p>People may also refer to mood disorders as affective disorders or depressive disorders. People with
                    these
                    conditions have significant changes in mood, generally involving either mania, which is a period of
                    high
                    energy and elation, or depression. Examples of mood disorders include:</p>

                <br> <br>
                <h3>Major depression</h3>
                <br>
                <p>An individual with major depression experiences a constant low mood and loses
                    interest in activities and events that they previously enjoyed. They can feel prolonged periods
                    of sadness or extreme sadness.</p>

                <br> <br>
                <h3>Bipolar disorder</h3>
                <br>
                <p>A person with bipolar disorder experiences unusual changes in their mood, energy levels, levels of
                    activity, and ability to continue with daily life. Periods of high
                    mood are known as manic phases, while depressive phases bring on low mood.</p>

                <br> <br>
                <h3>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Reduced daylight triggers during the fall, winter, and early
                    spring months trigger this type of major depression. It is most common in countries far from the
                    equator.</p>

                <br> <br>
                <h3>Schizophrenia disorders</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Signs of schizophrenia typically develop between the ages of 16 and 30 years, according to the NIMH.
                    The
                    individual will have thoughts that appear fragmented, and they may also find it hard to process
                    information. Schizophrenia has negative and positive symptoms. Positive symptoms include delusions,
                    thought
                    disorders, and hallucinations. Negative symptoms include withdrawal, lack of motivation, and a flat
                    or
                    inappropriate mood.</p>
